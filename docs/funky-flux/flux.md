In my attempts to come up with a [backup-strategy]({{ site.url }}/docs/funky-flux/backup-strat/) I came across a [tutorial for running velero](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/kubernetes/backup/velero/) that looked great. However, I didn't quite realize the dependencies this required that were basically conforming you to how one guy decided to set up his homelab. He used a tool called [flux](https://fluxcd.io/) which I found perfect for my needs but modified their official patterns to fix his needs in this [funky tutorial](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/kubernetes/deployment/flux/).

This will be the front page of building out my cluster using the patterns I've now adopted from [funky penguin](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz/). He clearly knows a lot more than you and I so it'll be fine.
