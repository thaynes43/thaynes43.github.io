A chart exists for cloudflare-ddns in the developers [repo](https://github.com/vandycknick/cloudflare-ddns) but it's not packaged or hosted anywhere. This seems easy enough to do with [these steps](https://medium.com/containerum/how-to-make-and-share-your-own-helm-package-50ae40f6c221) and it'll be a good skill to have later on when I make charts from scratch so I will likely do so. 

Or I could just use the one from [true charts](https://github.com/truecharts/charts/tree/master/charts/stable/cloudflareddns)

For now...
