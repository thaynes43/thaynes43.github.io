PVE04 is weird. I made [this comment](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/minisforum-ms-01-pcie-card-and-ram-compatibility-thread.42785/post-440645) on the HW thread to see if anyone has similar problems.

I have also received some help [here](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/node-drops-from-cluster-when-pbs-kicks-in.154245/post-702959) on the proxmox forums.

So far the A2000 GPU seems to totally fuck up the thing. The RX6800 was much more stable but that had external power.
