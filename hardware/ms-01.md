I was interested in setting up a small Proxmox HA cluster using Ceph to tick the shared data store requirement. I didn't want used enterprise gear but needed fast networking. The [Minisforum MS-01](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-ms-01) wasn't out at the time I was looking but was worth the wait. Anything else would have cost much more and so far they have worked very well for my needs.

So all in all the project was looking to cost $4,300 which was a significant investment for a high risk new product with a laptop CPU. However, it feels less expensive in the moment since the cost is distributed across vendors! 

### Parts

#### Minisforum MS-01

The [Minisforum MS-01](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-ms-01) was arguably the most important part as it enabled the rest of the spending. I went with the [13900H Barebone](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-ms-01?variant=44385972158709) model because it was the only one available at the time but I don't regret it.

The MS-01 was a bit larger than most of the NUCs you'd see but could fit 3 NVMes and a 16 slot x8 speed PCIE card (one slot wide).

![ms-01 web]({{ site.url }}/images/builds/ms-01/ms-01.png)

It had two SFP+ ports, two USB4, and two 2.5Gbe which adds up to 65Gbps of networking capabilities (kinda)! 

![ms-01 ports]({{ site.url }}/images/builds/ms-01/website-ports.png)

The initial goal was to use the 20Gb Thunderbolt network for Ceph's private network and SFP+ for it's public plus have other adapters for other things the VMs would require. Ultimately I switched the Ceph private network over to SFP+ because it I wanted more than three nodes and 10Gb was fast enough for my needs.

#### Crucial DDR5 96GB Laptop RAM

Officially the MS-01 supports 64GB of RAM but strangers on the internet said 96GB would be fine and so far they've been dead on. With 20 threads from the [i9-13900H](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/232135/intel-core-i9-13900h-processor-24m-cache-up-to-5-40-ghz.html) I figured more RAM wouldn't hurt.

#### Crucial T500 1TB Gen4 NVMe

The name of the game for these M.2's were something cheap that I could install Proxmox on and use for a select few VMs that wouldn't need to be highly available like k8s nodes which will already re-balance pods if any go down.

#### Samsung PM983a NVMe PCIe M.2 22110 1.88TB

This was a tricky one but things have been looking good. I wanted an enterprise M.2 with PLP for Ceph since it's what Ceph recommends and I'm already going through a lot of trouble to make a highly available cluster that it's not worth saving some money to end up with a corrupt OSD after a power failure. 

eBay was the only option for these but everything has been fine so far and I've since purchased four more.

#### Cables

USB4 cables on Amazon are always a risky click unless you go with a brand you can trust. I tent to stick with Anker, Cable Matters, or Monoprice. Ugreen seems to be gaining popularity now for things and I've grabbed a few of theirs too.

Now a days I get most of my DAC and ethernet cables from [Unifi](https://store.ui.com/us/en). I did purchase a [10Gtek DAC](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B6J2KL9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) when their 3m ones were sold out which was fine but I'm usually on there blowing the budget anyway so I throw in a few cables.  

## Assembly 

I captured enough pictures to "unbox" this live so bare with me. I put together a nice loot pile before starting the lob:

The device came nicely packaged in a little cube:

Opening it up reveled a nicely wrapped mini workstation:

Next came cracking it open. The lid slid off easily:

### GPU (Optional)

I decided to install an Radeon RX 6400 in one of the nodes to get a feel for how it'd perform, fit, and how hot it'd run.
