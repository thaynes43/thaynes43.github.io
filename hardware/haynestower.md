HaynesTower is my unRAID server. It suggested I name it Tower so I put Haynes in front and listened. This server ignited the home lab'er in me and ruined my wallet. 

I had been running a Plex server for about 8 years before HaynesTower came into existence. I was called HaynesServer but wasn't a very good server. I'll try and write something up about it because it's a good story but it doubled as my sons youtube and light gaming PC for years. Once I filled all of the drive bays (chassis was from the 2000s so it had those) I started adding externals.
