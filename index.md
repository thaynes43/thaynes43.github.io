Hello! I'm Tom. Welcome to some pages about my homelab. This site is currently under construction as the lab has significantly changed since it moved.

This site captures the hardware in the lab and how it is setup. For detailed information on the services being hosted I plan to build out [HaynesOps](https://haynesops.com/).

Here's the latest look at hayneslab:
