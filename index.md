Hello! I'm Tom and this is a website I use to muse over recent aventures in homelabbing. 

You may find useful info here to help you avoid the mistakes I've made (which accounts for most of the mistakes that could be made I believe) or you may see things I've done blantently wrong and feel compelled to correct me (once the commens work). Either way I hope you enjoy the content.
