Hello! I'm Tom and this is a website I use to muse over recent adventures in the home lab.

You may find useful info here to help you avoid the mistakes I've made (which accounts for most of the mistakes that could be made) or you may see things I've done blatantly wrong and feel compelled to correct me (once the comments work). Either way I hope you enjoy the content.

Rather than re-write tutorials that are based off of already re-written tutorials this site servers as a reference to the references I used. I will include how it went for me, what pitfalls I could have avoided, and what I learned from the experience. I will also share my configs in hopes to help other folks trying to server their own services.

Fair warning, I do not plan to keep anything up to date. If I have to go back and do major re-work to update something I will include that but for things that but the installation steps for things will change over the years and it's best to read documentation from the source (and make sure the project is still maintained!)
