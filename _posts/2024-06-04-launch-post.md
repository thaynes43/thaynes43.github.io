The site has launched! Not sure what I will use these posts for but check back for more content as I build things out in the coming weeks. Then I will pivot to a document as I go approach to keep track of the services and infrastructure I setup. Come November there will be a massive disruption while I move the lab to a new residence and we'll have some fun after that getting things back in order.
