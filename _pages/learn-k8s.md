I stumbled across [kubernetes the hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) and I wanted to give it a good read and review but didn't have time so I made this page as a placeholder...

Before starting:

1. Hello world app
2. Dockerfile for it
3. Helm chart for it
4. Pipeline for all that so you can CI/CD
5. Hello there world auto deploy
