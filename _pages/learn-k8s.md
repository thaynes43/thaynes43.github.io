I stumbled across [kubernetes the hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) and I wanted to give it a good read and review but didn't have time so I made this page as a placeholder...

Before starting:

1. Hello world app
2. Dockerfile for it
3. Helm chart for it
4. Pipeline for all that so you can CI/CD
5. Hello there world auto deploy


## Learn YAML

For what we are doing YAML is going to be written more than code. YAML is easy enough that you think you're all set right off the bat but then get confused when you see fancy stuff like anchors and aliases. 

[Here](https://dev.to/kalkwst/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-yaml-format-bi6) is a code cheat sheet to start with and [here](https://www.educative.io/blog/advanced-yaml-syntax-cheatsheet) explains ome advanced syntax but is mostly redundant. [This](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/yaml-collections-sequences-and-mappings-4meb) helps break down block vs flow collections.
