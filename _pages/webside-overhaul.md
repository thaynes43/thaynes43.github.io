The primary purpose of this is to act as my notebook as I work my way through the various puzzling and out of date tutorials that come with setting up a homelab. However, I'd like it to be useful for others too.

## Ideas

Few ideas:

- Don't present anything as tutorials, rather as challenges or puzzles for people to solve
- Include which I have solved and which I gave up or pivoted on, maybe use spoiler like drop downs for challenges
- Achievement system would gameify the toil but may be a lot of effort to set up

Comments on the articles will be critical. They go out of data and people can help each other in the comments by saying what had changed. Also good to get feedback on what I could do better
