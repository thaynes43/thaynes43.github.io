Some blessed angel made [these](https://proxmox-helper-scripts.vercel.app/) helper scripts for proxmox that are so good they deserve a proper page.

## Script Experience

In this section I will document which scripts I've used and how they made my life better.

### Number 1 - Debian LXC

The [debian lxc script](https://proxmox-helper-scripts.vercel.app/scripts?id=Debian) makes it a breeze to set up an LXC that you can use to host things not already scripted. So far I am using this for:

- Any NUT server
- Nginx for my k3s load balancer
- Haproxy to load balance PVE and Ceph dashboards incase a node goes down

## Scripts I Want to Try
